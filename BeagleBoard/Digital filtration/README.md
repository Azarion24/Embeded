# ðŸŽ¶ Real-Time Signal Processing with FIR Filter

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project implements a **real-time FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filter** on the **BB AI** module, utilizing **interrupt-driven data acquisition**. It processes audio signals and applies a **custom FIR filter** for signal conditioning, useful for applications like noise reduction or frequency shaping.

## ðŸ›  Features  
âœ… **Real-time FIR filtering**  
âœ… **Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter implementation**  
âœ… **Windowed FIR filter coefficients**  
âœ… **Audio processing using McASP interface**  
âœ… **Interrupt-driven data handling**  
âœ… **Round-off filtering for accurate signal transmission**  

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure  
- `codec/codec_v1_0.c` â€“ Codec configuration for audio signal processing  
- `fft/DSPF_sp_cfftr2_dit.c` â€“ Optimized FFT implementation (not used directly, but referenced for potential signal analysis)  
- `main.c` â€“ Main source file handling interrupt processing and FIR filtering  
- `math.h` â€“ Mathematical functions for signal processing  

## ðŸ“¡ How It Works  
1. **Audio data** is captured from **McASP1** via an interrupt-driven process.  
2. The incoming samples are stored in a buffer and processed using a **FIR filter** with predefined coefficients.  
3. The filter applies weighted sums of the recent samples, controlled by the **filter coefficients** defined in the array `B[]`.  
4. The filtered sample is rounded to the nearest integer for transmission.  
5. The processed audio is sent back through **McASP1**.
